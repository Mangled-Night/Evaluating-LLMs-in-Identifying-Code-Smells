/** 
 * Updates or creates the trigger of the given object. The entity must have a TriggerComponent, LocationComponent and ShapeComponent to have a trigger. When updating an existing trigger the location and scale are updated. <br><br> An entity with a trigger attached to it will generate collision pairs when it collides or intersects with other objects. A good example of its usage is picking up items. By creating a trigger for a player, a collision event will be generated when the shape of the player collides with the shape of a dropped item. This event is not send by the PhysicsEngine class. Instead it is stored and can be retrieved by the getCollisionPairs() method.
 * @param entity the entity of which the trigger may need updating.
 * @return true if there was already a trigger for the given entity, falseotherwise.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if a new trigger must be made, but theentity does not have a LocationComponent, TriggerComponent and ShapeComponent.
