 * Used to obtain the set of StateChange objects representing the state changes desired by the node. To function correctly a node may require an OpenGL state that is different from the one Terasology provides by default. To modify the OpenGL state and restore it after use, a node stores the Set of StateChange objects that is returned by this method. They are "desired" state changes as some might end up redundant and unused: if consecutive nodes A and B desire an identical state change the state change provided by node A is used and automatically persists during the processing of node B - node B's state change is unused.
 * @return a Set of StateChange objects.
