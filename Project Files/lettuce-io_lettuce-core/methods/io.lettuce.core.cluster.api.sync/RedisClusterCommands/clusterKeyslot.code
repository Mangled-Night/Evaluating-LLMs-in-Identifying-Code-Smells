/** 
 * Returns an integer identifying the hash slot the specified key hashes to. This command is mainly useful for debugging and testing, since it exposes via an API the underlying Redis implementation of the hashing algorithm. Basically the same as {@link io.lettuce.core.cluster.SlotHash#getSlot(byte[])}. If not, call Houston and report that we've got a problem.
 * @param key the key.
 * @return Integer reply: The hash slot number.
