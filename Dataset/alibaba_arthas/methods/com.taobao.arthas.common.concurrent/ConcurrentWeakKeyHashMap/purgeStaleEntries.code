 * Removes any stale entries whose keys have been finalized. Use of this method is normally not necessary since stale entries are automatically removed lazily, when blocking operations are required. However, there are some cases where this operation should be performed eagerly, such as cleaning up old references to a ClassLoader in a multi-classloader environment. Note: this method will acquire locks, one at a time, across all segments of this table, so if it is to be used, it should be used sparingly.
