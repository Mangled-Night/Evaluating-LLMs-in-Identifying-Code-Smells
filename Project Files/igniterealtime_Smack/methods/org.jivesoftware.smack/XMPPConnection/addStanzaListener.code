The stanza filter determines which stanzas will be delivered to the listener. It is guaranteed that the same listener will not be invoked concurrently and the the order of invocation will reflect the order in which the stanzas have been received. If the same stanza listener is added again with a different filter, only the new filter will be used.
 * @param stanzaListener the stanza listener to notify of new received stanzas.
 * @param stanzaFilter the stanza filter to use.
