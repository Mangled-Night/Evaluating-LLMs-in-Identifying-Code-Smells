 * Sets the safety timeout (default 30s).
 * @param safetyTimeoutMs The safety timeout applies to {@link #runWhile runWhile} and related helpers, and stops execution whenthe specified number of real time milliseconds has passed. Note that this is different from the timeout parameter of those methods, which is specified in game time. <p> When a single  {@code run*} helper invocation exceeds the safety timeout, MTE asserts false to explicitly fail the test.<p> The safety timeout exists to prevent indefinite execution in Jenkins or long IDE test runs, and should be adjusted as needed so that tests pass reliably in all environments.
