/** 
 * Indicates the start of an activity. All started activities must either be ended with a call to endActivity() (see example 1) or take advantage of the autocloseable interface implemented by Activity (see example 2).<br> <br> Example 1 - explicitly ending an activity: <pre> PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity") doSomething(); PerformanceMonitor.endActivity() </pre> Example 2 - the end of the activity is handled internally: <pre> try (Activity ignored = PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity") { doSomething(); } </pre> The latter case is particularly useful whenever the activity's code has a number of possible exit paths, as it might be undesirable or simply non-trivial to add an endActivity() call at the end of each.<br> <br> Activities may be nested. Example: (the indentation pattern is not strictly necessary) <pre> PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myActivity") doSomething(); PerformanceMonitor.startActivity("myNestedActivity") doSomethingNested(); PerformanceMonitor.endActivity() doSomethingElse() PerformanceMonitor.endActivity() </pre>
 * @param activityName the name of the activity starting.
