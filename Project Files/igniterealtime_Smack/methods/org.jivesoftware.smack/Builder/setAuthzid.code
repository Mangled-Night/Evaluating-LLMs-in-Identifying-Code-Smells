 * Set the XMPP address to be used as authorization identity. <p> In XMPP, authorization identities are bare jids. In general, callers should allow the server to select the authorization identifier automatically, and not call this. Note that setting the authzid does not set the XMPP service domain, which should typically match. Calling this will also SASL CRAM, since this mechanism does not support authzid. </p>
