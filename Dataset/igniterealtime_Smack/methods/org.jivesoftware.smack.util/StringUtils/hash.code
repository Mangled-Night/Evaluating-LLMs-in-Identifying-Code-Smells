/** 
 * Hashes a String using the SHA-1 algorithm and returns the result as a String of hexadecimal numbers. This method is synchronized to avoid excessive MessageDigest object creation. If calling this method becomes a bottleneck in your code, you may wish to maintain a pool of MessageDigest objects instead of using this method. <p> A hash is a one-way function -- that is, given an input, an output is easily computed. However, given the output, the input is almost impossible to compute. This is useful for passwords since we can store the hash and a hacker will then have a very hard time determining the original password.
 * @param data the String to compute the hash of.
 * @return a hashed version of the passed-in String
 * @deprecated use {@link org.jivesoftware.smack.util.SHA1#hex(String)} instead.
