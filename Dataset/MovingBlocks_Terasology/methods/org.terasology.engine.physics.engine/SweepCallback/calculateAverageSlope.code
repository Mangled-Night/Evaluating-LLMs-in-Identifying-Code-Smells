 * This method determines the average slope of the hit location. This can differ from that provided by the hit normal, as the hit normal is subject to local features and discontinuities. Using an average protects against this.

 * @param checkingOffset How far to go up and down from the current position for the positions to check between.
 * @return a safer slope to use for character movement calculations.
