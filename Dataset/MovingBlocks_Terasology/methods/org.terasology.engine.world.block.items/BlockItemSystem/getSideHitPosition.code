/** 
 * Returns the position at which the block side was hit, relative to the side. <p/> The specified hit position is expected to be on the surface of the cubic block at the specified position. Example: The front side was hit right in the center. The result will be (0.5, 0.5), representing the relative hit position on the side's surface.
 * @param hitPosition the hit position
 * @param blockPosition the block position relative to its center (block (0, 0, 0) has block position (0.5, 0.5,0.5))
 * @return the 2D hit position relative to the side that was hit
