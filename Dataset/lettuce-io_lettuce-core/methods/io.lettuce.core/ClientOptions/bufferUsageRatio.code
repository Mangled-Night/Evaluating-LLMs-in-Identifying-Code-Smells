/** 
 * Buffer usage ratio for  {@link io.lettuce.core.protocol.CommandHandler}. This ratio controls how often bytes are discarded during decoding. In particular, when buffer usage reaches  {@code bufferUsageRatio / bufferUsageRatio + 1}. E.g. setting  {@code bufferUsageRatio} to {@literal 3}, will discard read bytes once the buffer usage reaches 75 percent. See  {@link #DEFAULT_BUFFER_USAGE_RATIO}.
 * @param bufferUsageRatio the buffer usage ratio. Must be between {@code 0} and {@code 2^31-1}, typically a value between 1 and 10 representing 50% to 90%.
 * @return {@code this}
 * @since 5.2
 * @deprecated since 6.0 in favor of {@link DecodeBufferPolicy}.
