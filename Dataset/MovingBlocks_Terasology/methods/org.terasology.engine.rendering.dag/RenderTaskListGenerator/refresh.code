/** 
 * Forces a refresh of the task list using the latest node list provided to the generateFrom method. A refresh is useful when one of the nodes has been enabled or disabled, as the tasks associated with it need to be added to the task list or removed from it. Tasks "downstream" of the change need to be re-evaluated then, as they might have become redundant. At this stage the refresh uses a brute-force approach: the whole task list is cleared and regenerated. Eventually it will be useful to make sure that only tasks affected by a change are regenerated.
