/** 
 * Returns a list of HostAddresses under which the specified XMPP server can be reached at for client-to-server communication. A DNS lookup for a SRV record in the form "_xmpp-client._tcp.example.com" is attempted, according to section 3.2.1 of RFC 6120. If that lookup fails, it's assumed that the XMPP server lives at the host resolved by a DNS lookup at the specified domain on the default port of 5222. <p> As an example, a lookup for "example.com" may return "im.example.com:5269". </p>
 * @param domain the domain.
 * @param lookupFailures on optional list that will be populated with host addresses that failed to resolve.
 * @param dnssecMode DNSSec mode.
 * @return List of HostAddress, which encompasses the hostname and port that theXMPP server can be reached at for the specified domain.
