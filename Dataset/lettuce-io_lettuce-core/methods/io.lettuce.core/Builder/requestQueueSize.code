 * Set the per-connection request queue size. The command invocation will lead to a  {@link RedisException} if the queuesize is exceeded. Setting the  {@code requestQueueSize} to a lower value will lead earlier to exceptions duringoverload or while the connection is in a disconnected state. A higher value means hitting the boundary will take longer to occur, but more requests will potentially be queued up and more heap space is used. Defaults to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}. See  {@link #DEFAULT_REQUEST_QUEUE_SIZE}.
 * @param requestQueueSize the queue size.
