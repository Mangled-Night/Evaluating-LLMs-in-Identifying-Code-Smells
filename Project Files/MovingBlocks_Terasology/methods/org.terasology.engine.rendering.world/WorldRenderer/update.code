/** 
 * Called potentially multiple times per frame, this method allows the renderer to trigger the update of any data it requires with a higher frequency than just once per frame. This is usually not necessary. Normally a renderer is interested in data updated with the same frequency as it renders to the display, once per frame. As such, implementations might want to leave this method fairly lightweight, with most updates occurring somewhere at the beginning of the render() method execution instead. However, there are effects for which it would be beneficial to have more frequent updates, for example multi-segment motion blur.
 * @param delta The elapsed time, in seconds, since the previous update.
