 * Returns a destructive iterator for iterating over the entries of this map. It frees each page as it moves onto next one. Notice: it is illegal to call any method on the map after `destructiveIterator()` has been called. For efficiency, all calls to `next()` will return the same  {@link Location} object.If any other lookups or operations are performed on this map while iterating over it, including `lookup()`, the behavior of the returned iterator is undefined.
