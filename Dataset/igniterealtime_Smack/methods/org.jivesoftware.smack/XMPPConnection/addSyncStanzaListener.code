/** 
 * Registers a <b>synchronous</b> stanza listener with this connection. A stanza listener will be invoked only when an incoming stanza is received. A stanza filter determines which stanzas will be delivered to the listener. If the same stanza listener is added again with a different filter, only the new filter will be used. <p> <b>Important:</b> This stanza listeners will be called in the same <i>single</i> thread that processes all incoming stanzas. Only use this kind of stanza filter if it does not perform any XMPP activity that waits for a response. Consider using  {@link #addAsyncStanzaListener(StanzaListener,StanzaFilter)} when possible, i.e. whenthe invocation order doesn't have to be the same as the order of the arriving stanzas. If the order of the arriving stanzas, consider using a  {@link StanzaCollector} when possible.</p>
 * @param stanzaListener the stanza listener to notify of new received stanzas.
 * @param stanzaFilter the stanza filter to use.
