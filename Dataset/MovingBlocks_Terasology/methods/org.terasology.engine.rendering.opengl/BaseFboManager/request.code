/** 
 * Returns an FBO with the characteristics defined by the FboConfig provided in input. Normally this method always returns an FBO with the requested characteristics, either because one exists already or because the manager creates one on the first request for it. This method can however throw an IllegalArgumentException if an FBO with the name in the FboConfig already exists within the manager but has different characteristics. However, separate managers may use the same fboName for FBOs having different characteristics. Callers of this method must eventually call the method release() to ensure that unused FBOs are eventually disposed.
 * @param fboConfig an FboConfig object providing the characteristics of the requested FBO.
 * @return an FBO object with the requested characteristics.
