/** 
 * Remove the entity from the pool. This does not destroy the entity, it only removes the  {@link BaseEntityRef}and the  {@link Component}s from this pool, so that the entity can be moved to a different pool. It does not invalidate the  {@link EntityRef}. Returns an  {@link Optional} {@link BaseEntityRef} if it was removed, ready to be put into another pool. Ifnothing was removed, return  {@link Optional#empty()}. This method is intended for use by  {@link EngineEntityManager#moveToPool(long,EngineEntityPool)}. Caution should be taken if this method is used elsewhere, and the caller should ensure that the the entity is immediately placed in a new pool. All of the components are removed, so should be manually copied before this method is called if they are to be kept in use.
 * @param id the id of the entity to remove
 * @return an optional {@link BaseEntityRef}, containing the removed entity
