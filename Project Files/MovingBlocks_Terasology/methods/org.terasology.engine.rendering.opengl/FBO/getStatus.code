/** 
 * Retrieves the status of the FBO. A usable FBO is one with a COMPLETE status. If the status is INCOMPLETE something went wrong during the allocation process on the GPU. Causes can range from mismatched dimensions to missing attachments, among others. The precise error code can be obtained browsing the log. Using an FrameBuffer that is not COMPLETE is an error and at this stage it is probably unrecoverable. No exceptions are thrown however and it is up to the calling code to decide how to react to an it. An FBO will have a DISPOSED status if the dispose() method has been called on it, which means the underlying FrameBuffer is no longer available to the GPU. The FBO is also automatically disposed if it is of Type.NO_COLOR and the internal call to glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT() returns GL_FRAMEBUFFER_INCOMPLETE_READ_BUFFER_EXT. This occurs on some graphic cards and the resulting FBO should not be used. An UNEXPECTED status cover all other (unknown) cases and the resulting FBO is probably as dysfunctional as an INCOMPLETE or a DISPOSED one.
 * @return  Status.COMPLETE, Status.INCOMPLETE, Status.DISPOSED or Status.UNEXPECTED
