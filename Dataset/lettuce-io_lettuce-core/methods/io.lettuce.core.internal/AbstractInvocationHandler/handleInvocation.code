 * {@link #invoke} delegates to this method upon any method invocation on the proxy instance, except {@link Object#equals}, {@link Object#hashCode} and {@link Object#toString}. The result will be returned as the proxied method's return value. <p> Unlike  {@link #invoke},  {@code args} will never be null. When the method has no parameter, an empty array is passed in.
 * @param proxy the proxy instance that the method was invoked on
 * @param method the {@code Method} instance corresponding to the interface method invoked on the proxy instance. Thedeclaring class of the  {@code Method} object will be the interface that the method was declared in, which may be asuperinterface of the proxy interface that the proxy class inherits the method through.
 * @param args an array of objects containing the values of the arguments passed in the method invocation on the proxyinstance, or  {@code null} if interface method takes no arguments. Arguments of primitive types are wrapped ininstances of the appropriate primitive wrapper class, such as  {@code java.lang.Integer} or{@code java.lang.Boolean}.
 * @return the invocation result value
 * @throws Throwable the exception to throw from the method invocation on the proxy instance.
