/** 
 * Perform a lightweight  {@literal PING} connection handshake when establishing a Redis connection. If {@code true} (defaultis  {@code true}), every connection and reconnect will issue a  {@literal PING} command and await its response before theconnection is activated and enabled for use. If the check fails, the connect/reconnect is treated as a failure. This option has no effect unless forced to use the RESP 2 protocol version. RESP 3/protocol discovery performs a  {@code HELLO}handshake. <p> The  {@literal PING} handshake validates whether the other end of the connected socket is a service that behaves like aRedis server.
 * @return {@code true} if {@literal PING} handshake is enabled.
