/** 
 * This callback is used to get the current value of the period in which Smack does bundle and defer outgoing stanzas. <p> Smack will bundle and defer stanzas if the connection is authenticated and if a bundle and defer callback is set, either via {@link XMPPTCPConnection#setDefaultBundleAndDeferCallback(BundleAndDeferCallback)} or{@link XMPPTCPConnection#setBundleandDeferCallback(BundleAndDeferCallback)}, and {@link #getBundleAndDeferMillis(BundleAndDefer)} returns a positive value. In a mobile environment, bundlingand deferring outgoing stanzas may reduce battery consumption. It heavily depends on the environment, but recommend values for the bundle and defer period range from 20-60 seconds. But keep in mind that longer periods decrease the realtime aspect of Smack. </p> <p> Smack will invoke the callback when it needs to know the length of the bundle and defer period. If  {@link #getBundleAndDeferMillis(BundleAndDefer)} returns 0 or a negative value, then thestanzas will send immediately. You can also prematurely abort the bundling of stanzas by calling {@link BundleAndDefer#stopCurrentBundleAndDefer()}. </p>
