/** 
 * Creates a new Collider. Colliders are similar to rigid bodies, except that they do not respond to forces from the physics engine. They collide with other objects and other objects may move if colliding with a collider, but the collider itself will only respond to movement orders from outside the physics engine. Colliders also detect any objects colliding with them. Allowing them to be used as sensors.
 * @param pos The initial position of the collider.
 * @param shape The shape of this collider.
 * @param groups
 * @param filters
 * @param collisionFlags
 * @param entity The entity to associate this collider with. Can be null.
 * @return The newly created and added to the physics engine, Collider object.
