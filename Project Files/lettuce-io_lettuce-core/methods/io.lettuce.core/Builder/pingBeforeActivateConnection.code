If thecheck fails, the connect/reconnect is treated as a failure. This option has no effect unless forced to use the RESP 2 protocol version. RESP 3/protocol discovery performs a  {@code HELLO} handshake.<p> The  {@literal PING} handshake validates whether the other end of the connected socket is a service that behaves likea Redis server.
