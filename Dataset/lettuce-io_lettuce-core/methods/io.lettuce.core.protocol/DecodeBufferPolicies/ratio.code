/** 
 * Ratio-based discard policy that considers the capacity vs. usage of the aggregation buffer. This strategy optimizes for CPU usage vs. memory usage by considering the usage ratio. Higher values lead to more memory usage. <p> The ratio is calculated with  {@code bufferUsageRatio/(1+bufferUsageRatio)} which gives 50% for a value of {@code 1}, 66% for  {@code 2} and so on.
 * @param bufferUsageRatio the buffer usage ratio. Must be between {@code 0} and {@code 2^31-1}, typically a value between 1 and 10 representing 50% to 90%.
 * @return the new strategy object.
