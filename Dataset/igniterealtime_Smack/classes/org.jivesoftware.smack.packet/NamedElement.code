 * Interface to represent a XML element. This is similar to  {@link ExtensionElement}, but does not carry a single namespace, but instead is used with multiple namespaces. Examples for this include MUC's &lt;destroy/&gt; element. <p> Please note that usage of this interface is <b>discouraged</b>. The reason is that every XML element is fully qualified, i.e., it is qualified by a namespace. The namespace may not be explicitly given, but instead, is inherited from an outer element. Use  {@link XmlElement} instead when possible.</p>
