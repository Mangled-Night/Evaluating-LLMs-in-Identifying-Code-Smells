 * Returns the cap on the number of "idle" instances in the pool. If  {@code maxIdle} is set too low on heavily loadedsystems it is possible you will see objects being destroyed and almost immediately new objects being created. This is a result of the active threads momentarily returning objects faster than they are requesting them, causing the number of idle objects to rise above maxIdle. The best value for maxIdle for heavily loaded system will vary but the default is a good starting point.
