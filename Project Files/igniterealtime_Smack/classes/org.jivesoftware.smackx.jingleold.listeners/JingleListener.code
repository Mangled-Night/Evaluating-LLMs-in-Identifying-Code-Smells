/** 
 * Jingle listeners interface. This is the list of events that can be observed from a JingleSession and some sub negotiators. This listeners can be added to different elements of the Jingle model. For example, a JingleManager can notify any SessionRequestListenerListener listener when a new session request is received. In this case, the <i>sessionRequested()</i> of the listener will be executed, and the listener will be able to <i>accept()</i> or <i>decline()</i> the invitation.
