 * Registers an <b>asynchronous</b> stanza listener with this connection. A stanza listener will be invoked only when an incoming stanza is received.

Use this method if the order of the stanza listeners must not depend on the order how the stanzas where received. </p>

 * @param stanzaFilter the stanza filter to use.
