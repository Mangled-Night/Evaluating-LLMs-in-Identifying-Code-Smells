/** 
 * Use a dedicated  {@link reactor.core.scheduler.Scheduler} to emit reactive data signals. Enabling this option can beuseful for reactive sequences that require a significant amount of processing with a single/a few Redis connections. <p> A single Redis connection operates on a single thread. Operations that require a significant amount of processing can lead to a single-threaded-like behavior for all consumers of the Redis connection. When enabled, data signals will be emitted using a different thread served by  {@link ClientResources#eventExecutorGroup()}. Defaults to  {@code false} ,see  {@link #DEFAULT_PUBLISH_ON_SCHEDULER}.
