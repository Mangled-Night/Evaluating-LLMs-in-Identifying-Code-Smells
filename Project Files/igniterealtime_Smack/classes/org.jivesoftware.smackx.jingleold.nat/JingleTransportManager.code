/** 
 * Transport manager for Jingle. This class makes easier the use of transport resolvers by presenting a simple interface for algorithm selection. The transport manager also keeps the match between the resolution method and the &lt;transport&gt; element present in Jingle packets. As Jingle have many transport methods (official and unofficial methods), this abstract class helps us to extends the transport support of the API. This class must be used with a JingleManager instance in the following way: JingleManager jingleManager = new JingleManager(xmppConnection, new BasicTransportManager());
