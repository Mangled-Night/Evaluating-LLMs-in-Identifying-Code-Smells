 * Register a listener to be notified when new incoming data is available to be read on the  {@link #getInputStream input stream}. Only one listener is supported at a time. <p> More precisely, notifications are issued whenever the number of bytes available for immediate reading (i.e., the value returned by  {@link InputStream#available}) transitions from zero to non-zero. Note that (in general) multiple reads may be required to empty the buffer and reset this notification, because incoming bytes are being added to the internal buffer asynchronously. </p> <p> Notifications are only supported when a  {@link #setReaderThread reader thread} is enabled for the connection.</p>
