/** 
 * This facet represents the approximate height of the conceptual surface of the ground at each position. It may exclude local features such as caves. It is intended to be used to determine the altitude relative to the ground of features that are not placed directly on the surface, such as placing ores at a certain depth below ground. Things that require more precise details of where all the surfaces are should use the {@link SurfacesFacet} instead.
