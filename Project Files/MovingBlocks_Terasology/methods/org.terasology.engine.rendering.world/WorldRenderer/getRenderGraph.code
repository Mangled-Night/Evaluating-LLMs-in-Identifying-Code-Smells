/** 
 * Returns the RenderGraph. This object is used by Engine and Modules to add/remove Nodes to/from the rendering process. Nodes encapsulate the rendering functionality of the renderer. A node might provide a basic rendering of the landscape, another might add deferred lighting to it while another might add tone mapping to the resulting 2d image. Arbitrary features and effects can be added or removed by adding or removing nodes to the graph and connecting them appropriately with other nodes.
 * @return the RenderGraph containing the nodes used by the rendering process.
