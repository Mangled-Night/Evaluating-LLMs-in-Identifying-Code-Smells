/** 
 * This interface defines  {@link ExtensionElement} implementations that contain otherextensions.  This effectively extends the idea of an extension within one of the top level  {@link Stanza} types to consider any embedded element to be an extensionof its parent.  This more easily enables the usage of some of Smacks parsing utilities such as  {@link PacketParserUtils#parseExtensionElement(String,String,org.jivesoftware.smack.xml.XmlPullParser,org.jivesoftware.smack.packet.XmlEnvironment)} to be usedto parse any element of the XML being parsed. <p>Top level extensions have only one element, but they can have multiple children, or their children can have multiple children.  This interface is a way of allowing extensions to be embedded within one another as a partial or complete one to one mapping of extension to element.
