 * Bans a user from the room. An admin or owner of the room can ban users from a room. This means that the banned user will no longer be able to join the room unless the ban has been removed. If the banned user was present in the room then he/she will be removed from the room and notified that he/she was banned along with the reason (if provided) and the bare XMPP user ID of the user who initiated the ban.
 * @param jid the bare XMPP user ID of the user to ban (e.g. "user@host.org").
 * @param reason the optional reason why the user was banned.
 * @throws XMPPErrorException if an error occurs banning a user. In particular, a405 error can occur if a moderator or a user with an affiliation of "owner" or "admin" was tried to be banned (i.e. Not Allowed error).
 * @throws NoResponseException if there was no response from the server.
 * @throws NotConnectedException if the XMPP connection is not connected.
 * @throws InterruptedException if the calling thread was interrupted.
