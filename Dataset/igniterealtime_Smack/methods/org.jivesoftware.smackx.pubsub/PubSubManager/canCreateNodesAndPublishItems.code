 * Check if it is possible to create PubSub nodes on this service. It could be possible that the PubSub service allows only certain XMPP entities (clients) to create nodes and publish items to them. <p> Note that since XEP-60 does not provide an API to determine if an XMPP entity is allowed to create nodes, therefore this method creates an instant node calling  {@link #createNode()} todetermine if it is possible to create nodes. </p>
 * @return <code>true</code> if it is possible to create nodes, <code>false</code> otherwise.
 * @throws NoResponseException if there was no response from the remote entity.
 * @throws NotConnectedException if the XMPP connection is not connected.
 * @throws InterruptedException if the calling thread was interrupted.
 * @throws XMPPErrorException if there was an XMPP error returned.
