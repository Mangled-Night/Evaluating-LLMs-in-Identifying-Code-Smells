/** 
 * Transfer an existing session support to another user or agent. The provided invitee's JID can be of a user, an agent, a queue or a workgroup. In the case of a queue or a workgroup the workgroup service will decide the best agent to receive the invitation.<p> This method will return either when the service returned an ACK of the request or if an error occurred while requesting the transfer. After sending the ACK the service will send the invitation to the target entity. When dealing with agents the common sequence of offer-response will be followed. However, when sending an invitation to a user a standard MUC invitation will be sent.<p> Once the invitee joins the support room the workgroup service will kick the inviter from the room.<p> Different situations may lead to a failed transfers. Possible cases are: 1) all agents rejected the offer and there are no agents available, 2) the agent that accepted the offer failed to join the room or 2) the user that received the MUC invitation never replied or joined the room. In any of these cases (or other failing cases) the inviter will get an error message with the failed notification.
 * @param type type of entity that will get the invitation.
 * @param invitee JID of entity that will get the invitation.
 * @param sessionID ID of the support session that the invitee is being invited.
 * @param reason the reason of the invitation.
 * @throws XMPPErrorException if the sender of the invitation is not an agent or the service failed to processthe request.
 * @throws NoResponseException if there was no response from the remote entity.
 * @throws NotConnectedException if the XMPP connection is not connected.
 * @throws InterruptedException if the calling thread was interrupted.
