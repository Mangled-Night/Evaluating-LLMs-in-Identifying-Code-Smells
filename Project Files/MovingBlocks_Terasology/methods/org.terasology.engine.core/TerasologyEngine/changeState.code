The change can be immediate, if there is no current game state set, or scheduled, when a current state exists and the new state is stored as pending. That been said, scheduled changes occurs in the main loop through the call processStateChanges(). As such, from a user perspective in normal circumstances, scheduled changes are likely to be perceived as immediate.
