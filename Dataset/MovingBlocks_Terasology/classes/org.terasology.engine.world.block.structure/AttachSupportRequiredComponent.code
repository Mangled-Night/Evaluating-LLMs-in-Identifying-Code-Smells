 * Component for block entities that are attached to another block and depend on this block allowing to have been attached to. The side it can be attached to is variable (i.e. torch attaches to 4 sides or bottom). If the supporting block is removed or changed to one that does not support attachment, the block (attachment) will be destroyed. The check for which side this block entity is attached to is done via BlockMeshPart.
