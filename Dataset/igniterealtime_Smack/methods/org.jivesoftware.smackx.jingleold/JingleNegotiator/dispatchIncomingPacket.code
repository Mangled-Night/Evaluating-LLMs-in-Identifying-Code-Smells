/** 
 * Dispatch an incoming packet. The negotiators form a tree relationship that roughly matches the Jingle stanza format: JingleSession Content Negotiator Media Negotiator Transport Negotiator Content Negotiator Media Negotiator Transport Negotiator &lt;jingle&gt; &lt;content&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;transport&gt; &lt;content&gt; &lt;description&gt; &lt;transport&gt; This way, each segment of a Jingle stanza has a corresponding negotiator that know how to deal with that part of the Jingle packet.  It also allows us to support Jingle packets of arbitraty complexity. Each parent calls dispatchIncomingPacket for each of its children.  The children then pass back a List of results that will get sent when we reach the top level negotiator (JingleSession).
 * @param iq the stanza received
 * @param id the ID of the response that will be sent
 * @return the new stanza to send (either a Jingle or an IQ error).
 * @throws XMPPException if an XMPP protocol error was received.
 * @throws SmackException if Smack detected an exceptional situation.
 * @throws InterruptedException if the calling thread was interrupted.
