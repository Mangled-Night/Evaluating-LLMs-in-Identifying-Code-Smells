/** 
 * Represents a command that is in a remote location. Invoking one of the {@link AdHocCommand.Action#execute execute},  {@link AdHocCommand.Action#next next}, {@link AdHocCommand.Action#prev prev},  {@link AdHocCommand.Action#cancel cancel} or{@link AdHocCommand.Action#complete complete} actions results in executing thataction in the remote location. In response to that action the internal state of the this command instance will change. For example, if the command is a single stage command, then invoking the execute action will execute this action in the remote location. After that the local instance will have a state of "completed" and a form or notes that applies.
