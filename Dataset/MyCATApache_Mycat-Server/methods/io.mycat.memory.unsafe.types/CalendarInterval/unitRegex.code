/** 
 * A function to generate regex which matches interval string's unit part like "3 years". First, we can leave out some units in interval string, and we only care about the value of unit, so here we use non-capturing group to wrap the actual regex. At the beginning of the actual regex, we should match spaces before the unit part. Next is the number part, starts with an optional "-" to represent negative value. We use capturing group to wrap this part as we need the value later. Finally is the unit name, ends with an optional "s".
