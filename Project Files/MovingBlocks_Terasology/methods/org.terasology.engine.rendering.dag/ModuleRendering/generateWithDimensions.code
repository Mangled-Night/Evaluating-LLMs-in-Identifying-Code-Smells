/** 
 * TODO UPDATE the javadoc, this method has been taken from abstractfbomanager during DAG Enhancement project Generates and returns an FBO as characterized by the FboConfig and the dimensions arguments. Notice that if the name of the FBO being generated matches the name of an FBO already stored by the manager, the latter will be overwritten. However, the GPU-side Frame Buffer associated with the overwritten FBO is not disposed by this method. As such, this method should be used only after the relevant checks are made and any pre-existing FBO with the same name as the new one is appropriately disposed. This method produces errors in the log in case the FBO generation process results in FBO.Status.INCOMPLETE or FBO.Status.UNEXPECTED.
 * @param fboConfig an FboConfig object providing FBO configuration details.
 * @param dimensions an FBO.Dimensions instance providing the dimensions of the FBO.
 * @return an FBO instance
