 * Returns a random String of numbers and letters (lower and upper case) of the specified length. The method uses the Random class that is built-in to Java which is suitable for low to medium grade security uses. This means that the output is only pseudo random, i.e., each number is mathematically generated so is not truly random.<p> The specified length must be at least one. If not, the method will return null.
 * @param length the desired length of the random String to return.
 * @return a random String of numbers and letters of the specified length.
